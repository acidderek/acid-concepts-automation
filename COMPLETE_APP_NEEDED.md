# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Your GitHub Repository Needs the Complete App.tsx

## Current Situation:
- **Your GitHub**: Has OLD version (~1,000 lines) with basic dashboard
- **Skywork Platform**: Has COMPLETE version (4,024 lines) with full integration
- **Your Vercel**: Deploying the OLD version from GitHub

## What You're Missing:
Your current GitHub App.tsx only shows:
```
Dashboard | Campaigns | Settings
Active Campaigns: 0
No active campaigns
Total Executions: 0
Success Rate: --
```

## What the COMPLETE version includes:
```
Dashboard | Campaigns | Comments | Analytics | Intelligence | Companies | Notifications | Settings
- Real database integration
- API key management with validation
- Campaign automation (start/stop)
- Document upload and AI processing
- Real-time notifications
- Analytics dashboard
- Multi-platform support
```

## ðŸŽ¯ SOLUTION:

I need to provide you with the complete App.tsx file (4,024 lines) that includes all the integrated features.

### OLD Version (Your GitHub):
- Basic dashboard with mock data
