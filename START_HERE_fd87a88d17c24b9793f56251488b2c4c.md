## 📁 Files You Need

Make sure you have these files in your project directory:

- ✅ `MAC_SETUP.sh` - Sets up your Mac with required tools
- ✅ `DEPLOY_MASTER.sh` - Master deployment script
- ✅ `deploy_to_github.sh` - GitHub deployment
- ✅ `setup_vercel_env.sh` - Vercel environment setup
- ✅ `quick_update.sh` - Quick updates
- ✅ `dev_sync.sh` - Development sync
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation
- ✅ `README.md` - Project documentation

## 🎯 Simple 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Setup Your Mac
```bash
./MAC_SETUP.sh
```
This installs Git, GitHub CLI, Node.js, Vercel CLI and authenticates everything.

### Step 2: Deploy Everything
```bash
./DEPLOY_MASTER.sh
```
This syncs to GitHub, sets up Vercel, and deploys your complete platform.

### Step 3: Test Your Deployment
Visit your Vercel URL and test:
- ✅ User registration/login
- ✅ API key management
- ✅ Campaign creation
- ✅ Document upload
- ✅ Notifications

## 🔗 Your Deployments

After successful deployment:
- **Skywork Demo**: https://rdgmbc35xr.skywork.website
- **Your Vercel Site**: Will be shown after deployment
- **GitHub Repo**: Your connected repository

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Check authentication**: Run `gh auth status` and `vercel whoami`
2. **Check repository**: Make sure your GitHub repo exists
3. **Check environment**: Run `./setup_vercel_env.sh` again
4. **Check logs**: Look at Vercel deployment logs
5. **Start fresh**: Delete `.git` folder and run setup again

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- ✅ GitHub repository is updated with all files
- ✅ Vercel deployment succeeds
- ✅ Application loads without errors
- ✅ You can sign up and login
- ✅ All features are functional

## 📞 Maintenance Going Forward

For future updates, I'll provide you with:
1. **Updated files** to replace in your project
2. **Simple commands** to run for deployment
3. **Both sites** (Skywork and Vercel) will be kept in sync

Just run `./quick_update.sh` after making any changes!
